### Additions
- Added Pastel gemstone shard "reconstruction" syntheses and data entry

### Changes
- Entropic Processor now inserts items dropped on top of it to its input slot (multyfora)
- Lightslash Blade's attack speed is constant again instead of variable, fixing its lack of proper cooldown
- Interaction with the Charger is now in-world, instead of via a GUI (multyfora)

### Fixes
- Item Nodes extracting from very large inventories should not consume as much ticktime anymore (TODO needs something that actually. does that)
