### Changes
- Entropic Processor now inserts items dropped on top of it to its input slot (multyfora)
- Lightslash Blade's attack speed is constant again instead of variable, fixing its lack of proper cooldown

### Fixes
- Item Nodes extracting from very large inventories should not consume as much ticktime anymore (TODO needs something that actually. does that)
